## Tweak Withdrawal Emergencies (working title)

A Rimworld mod that allows adjusting the Medical Emergency alert from gene-based chemical dependencies.

In the base game, this happens when the pawn goes comatose, which is still thirty(!) days from death.

This mod allows adjusting that threshold down as close to death as you want, or even disable it entirely!


The threshhold is separately adjustable for colonists and prisoners, so you can buy more time for colonists for example.
