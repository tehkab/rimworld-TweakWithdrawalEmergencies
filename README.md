## Tweak Withdrawal Emergencies

A Rimworld mod that allows adjusting the Medical Emergency alert from gene-based chemical dependencies.
In the base game, this happens when the pawn goes comatose, which is still thirty(!) days from death.
This mod allows adjusting that threshold down as close to death as you want, or even disable it entirely!

### TODO list

The threshold can be customized separately for colonists or prisoners.
